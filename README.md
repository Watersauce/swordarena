Directional attacks are changeable by movement.
Then you have your special ability, which defines your character, it either plays in by granting you dashing, blocking or something special.

<h3> <b> <~Characters~> </b> <h3>

Some characters have special rules tied with them, like the blue guy (Mage).

Each character displays a different playstyle.
Playable:
Pyro (Red/Fire Guy), kick people, shank them and wavedash in style.

Mage, (Blue Guy), Juggle people and dunk them with magic.


<h3> <b> <~More In-depth mechanics~> </b>

There are currently invincibilty frames while dashing, but they're very short to abuse.

You can currently wavedash and "dashcancel" with Pyro.
If you Attack > Dashcancel, you reset the attack animation. You can only wavedash with launching attack, otherwise you're just flinching an attack.
